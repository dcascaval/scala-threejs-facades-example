This is a fully contained starter example of using [scala-threejs-facades](https://github.com/dcascaval/scala-threejs-facades) in a project.

You will need to export a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable that can read from the Github Packages registry. In Github, go to `Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access tokens` and create a new one with permissions `read:packages`. Export this by adding it to `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent) and reloading your shell.

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your token>"
```
